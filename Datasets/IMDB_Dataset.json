{"0": {"review": "One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "NUM ADP DET ADJ NOUN AUX VERB SCONJ SCONJ VERB ADV NUM PROPN NOUN PRON AUX AUX VERB PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX ADV PRON VERB ADP PRON PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB PRON ADP PROPN AUX PRON NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP ADV ADP DET NOUN VERB PUNCT VERB PRON PUNCT PRON AUX PART DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ ADJ CCONJ ADJ PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ PUNCT ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX VERB PROPN SCONJ PRON AUX DET NOUN VERB ADP DET PROPN ADJ PROPN PROPN PROPN PUNCT PRON VERB ADV ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN SCONJ PRON DET NOUN VERB NOUN NOUN CCONJ VERB ADV PUNCT ADV NOUN AUX PART ADJ ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON PROPN AUX ADV ADP ADJ PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT ADJ CCONJ ADV PUNCT ADV NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN AUX ADV ADV ADV PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT AUX VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN AUX ADP ADP DET NOUN SCONJ PRON VERB SCONJ ADJ NOUN AUX PART VERB PUNCT VERB ADJ NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN PUNCT PROPN AUX PART VERB ADV PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN PRON ADV VERB VERB PRON SCONJ ADV ADJ PRON AUX ADJ PUNCT PRON AUX PART VERB PRON AUX ADJ ADP PRON PUNCT CCONJ SCONJ PRON VERB ADV PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT CCONJ AUX VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV ADV NOUN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN PRON AUX AUX VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN PRON AUX VERB ADP NOUN CCONJ VERB ADV ADP PRON PUNCT ADV ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN AUX VERB ADP NOUN NOUN ADP ADP PRON NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT VERB PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB ADJ ADP PRON AUX ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV SCONJ PRON AUX VERB ADP NOUN ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT", "xpos": "CD IN DT JJ NNS VBZ VBN IN IN VBG RB CD NNP NN PRP MD VB VBN .

You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears.

This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "PROPN PROPN PART PUNCT NOUN ADP DET PROPN ADP PROPN PUNCT AUX DET ADV ADJ NOUN PART VERB PUNCT PROPN PROPN VERB PRON DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX DET NOUN PRON VERB PART AUX VERB PRON DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN CCONJ NOUN VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX DET NOUN ADP DET PROPN PROPN PART NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADJ PROPN SCONJ DET DET ADJ NOUN VERB CCONJ VERB PUNCT DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP NUM NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB PART VERB SCONJ DET NOUN VERB CCONJ DET NOUN PRON VERB ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADP ADP DET DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN AUX DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN DET NOUN VERB PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN AUX PART ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADP PRON ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ NUM VERB AUX DET NOUN ADP ADJ ADP DET NOUN PRON VERB PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN AUX ADJ ADP PROPN PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB DET NOUN VERB ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON VERB PROPN PROPN ADJ NOUN CCONJ VERB ADV ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT", "xpos": "NNP NNP POS `` NN IN DT NNP IN NNP '' VBZ DT RB JJ NN TO VB .

I love them now for the unintentional humor.<br /><br />But, about a year or so later, I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was bumped off early in the film.

I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. <br /><br />People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.<br /><br />Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. So the tale goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. People have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. <br /><br />However, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making Genetically-Mutated-soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of \"SPOILER\" Vancouver for some reason. Thats right no palm trees here. Instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. We haven't even gone FAR before I started to CRY (mehehe) I cannot go on any more.. If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.<br /><br />There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse (that's poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead..

But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects.

That is what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone's career.<br /><br />Cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! However, if you an forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs.<br /><br />You've got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent, Rex Linn as Travers.<br /><br />He may of been Henry in 'Portrait of a Serial Killer' but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as Hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' And whilst he surely can't be, it really does look like Ralph Waite's Frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death.<br /><br />Mention too must go to former 'London's Burning' actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football, yes, you can't help enjoy that bit, Hal needed a good kicking.<br /><br />So forget your better judgement, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy!

This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill.<br /><br />The animation is VERY bad & cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I \"vividly\" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school... & it's the same kids over & over again! The FX are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel/Mike on MST3K (you pick the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time.<br /><br />Heck, I'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I'm giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5/10 I was originally going to give it.<br /><br />(According to my grading scale: 3/10 means Pretty much both boring & bad.

M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me. Nor does the development of the cop. It feels like one of many straight-to-video movies I saw back in the 90s ...

This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.<br /><br />I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. \"The Cell\" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more? Personally, I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.<br /><br />We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I do agree that the \"genre\" is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But \"The Cell\" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.<br /><br />I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. Instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. \"The Cell\" wants to let you \"see\" what it's all about and not \"how\" it's all about, and I guess that's what some people don't like. True, I do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.<br /><br />I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.<br /><br />I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself. Not because there's nothing else to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought \"The Cell\" was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as \"weird\" or \"crazy\". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard one audience member say \"Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs.\" If so, I want what he was smoking.<br /><br />**** (out of 4)", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT AUX DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADV ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADV ADP NUM ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ NOUN ADP PRON AUX AUX VERB SCONJ ADJ NOUN VERB PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT VERB ADP NOUN PART VERB ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN CCONJ VERB NOUN ADV ADJ PUNCT PRON AUX DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PART ADV VERB NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PART ADV VERB DET NOUN VERB PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN AUX AUX DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN SCONJ ADJ NOUN AUX ADV VERB PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT AUX ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADV AUX PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP PRON NOUN CCONJ VERB PRON CCONJ PRON NOUN PROPN PROPN SCONJ PRON AUX PART VERB DET ADJ PUNCT ADV PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADP VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT CCONJ AUX VERB PART VERB PRON VERB PART VERB PRON PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX ADV VERB NOUN SCONJ VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ INTJ PUNCT PRON AUX VERB SCONJ DET PUNCT NOUN PUNCT AUX DET NOUN ADJ PUNCT DET NOUN AUX ADJ ADP NOUN VERB PART VERB PRON VERB NOUN NOUN VERB PUNCT DET ADP PRON VERB PUNCT CCONJ ADV VERB PUNCT CCONJ PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT AUX PART VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ VERB ADP PRON ADJ ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN NOUN ADV VERB PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADP SCONJ DET NOUN AUX PART VERB PRON ADP ADP ADV ADV ADJ NOUN VERB PART VERB SCONJ PROPN PROPN ADV VERB PART VERB DET NOUN ADP DET PUNCT ADV PUNCT PRON ADV VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ AUX VERB SCONJ PRON VERB ADP ADV ADJ PROPN CCONJ VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT VERB PART VERB PRON PUNCT VERB PUNCT PRON PRON AUX ADV ADP CCONJ PART PUNCT SCONJ PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADP PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB PRON AUX PRON DET NOUN AUX PART VERB PUNCT ADJ PUNCT PRON AUX VERB NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT CCONJ SCONJ DET NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PRON AUX VERB PRON VERB PRON PRON VERB CCONJ ADV VERB PRON ADP PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT VERB SCONJ DET NOUN AUX ADV ADJ SCONJ PRON VERB NOUN PUNCT ADV PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN SCONJ ADP DET NOUN ADP DET PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN AUX ADV ADJ PUNCT PRON AUX PART AUX VERB SCONJ DET NOUN VERB ADV DET ADJ PROPN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX ADP ADP PRON PRON AUX ADP ADJ AUX VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX VERB SCONJ PRON AUX NOUN ADV AUX VERB PRON PUNCT ADV SCONJ PRON VERB PRON ADJ PART VERB PUNCT CCONJ SCONJ PRON AUX PART VERB ADV SCONJ ADJ PRON VERB PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT AUX PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN CCONJ PART VERB PRON VERB ADP ADP NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADV PRON AUX VERB DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN AUX ADV DET ADJ ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN PUNCT VERB PRON ADP ADP PUNCT ADJ PUNCT CCONJ PUNCT ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADV ADP NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV PRON AUX ADV ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT VERB DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB NUM NOUN NOUN VERB PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT SCONJ ADV PUNCT PRON VERB PRON PRON AUX VERB PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADP ADP NUM PUNCT", "xpos": "`` DT NN '' VBZ DT JJ NN , DT JJ NN IN RB RB DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN , CC RB IN CD IN DT RB JJ NN .

Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era \"Cold Mountain,\" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is such a film.<br /><br />Then again, calling Cold Mountain\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \"Glory\" director Edward Zwick shame. However, \"Cold Mountain\" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />\"Cold Mountain\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.<br /><br />Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern \"lawman,\" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by \"the war of Northern aggression,\" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Make no mistake, \"Cold Mountain\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "PUNCT PROPN NOUN PUNCT AUX DET PROPN NOUN PRON AUX AUX VERB CCONJ VERB ADV ADJ NOUN SCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN CCONJ ADJ DET PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN VERB ADP PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ VERB DET ADV ADJ CCONJ ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ PROPN PUNCT ADJ PROPN PUNCT PUNCT VERB PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN CCONJ PROPN PROPN AUX DET DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADV ADV PUNCT VERB ADJ PROPN PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN AUX PART ADV ADJ PUNCT ADJ ADV PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADP DET PUNCT ADV ADV PUNCT ADJ PUNCT CCONJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN PRON VERB PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PROPN PROPN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT PUNCT ADJ PROPN PUNCT AUX PART ADV ADV ADP DET ADJ PROPN PRON SCONJ PRON AUX ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADP VERB ADJ NOUN PROPN PUNCT VERB ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT PRON VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADJ ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN CCONJ DET ADV ADJ ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADP PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT VERB ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADJ SCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADV ADV VERB DET NOUN ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PART NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN AUX ADV ADJ CCONJ ADV ADV ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT SYM PUNCT ADJ PROPN PUNCT ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT SCONJ DET ADJ NOUN PROPN VERB ADP PART AUX DET NOUN PUNCT ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN SCONJ VERB PART VERB ADP DET PROPN PUNCT CCONJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADV PUNCT ADV PUNCT ADV ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PROPN PART VERB NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV PRON AUX VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT VERB ADP PROPN PART NOUN AUX DET NOUN PUNCT ADJ PUNCT NOUN PROPN PROPN PUNCT VERB ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT PRON VERB PROPN VERB DET NOUN ADV ADV CCONJ PUNCT ADV ADV ADV PUNCT VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN DET NOUN VERB PART AUX VERB ADP PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADP DET NUM NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ PUNCT ADJ CCONJ PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT ADV ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ PROPN VERB PUNCT DET NOUN ADP PRON PROPN CCONJ PROPN VERB AUX ADV ADJ PUNCT VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN PART ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN ADP DET ADJ ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ PROPN PROPN ADP DET ADV ADJ CCONJ VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET AUX AUX ADV VERB CCONJ VERB ADP PUNCT DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADV ADP DET ADJ PUNCT DET ADJ PUNCT ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB ADP DET ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADV ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN PROPN PUNCT AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN ADV ADV ADV ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP ADP DET VERB NOUN CCONJ VERB NOUN ADP PRON DET NOUN AUX VERB PUNCT SCONJ DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP NOUN PRON AUX VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN AUX ADV ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT NOUN PROPN PROPN VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN AUX ADV VERB ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADV VERB NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN AUX ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT SCONJ DET ADV ADJ PUNCT VERB CCONJ ADV ADJ NOUN ADP PRON NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT VERB DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADJ PROPN PUNCT VERB CCONJ DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PRON AUX ADJ PART ADV PART VERB CCONJ ADV PART ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB ADV ADP DET NOUN CCONJ ADV ADJ PART AUX ADJ ADP PRON ADJ NOUN ADV PUNCT", "xpos": "`` NNP NN '' VBZ DT NNP NN WDT VBZ VBN VBN CC VBN RB JJ NNS IN JJ NN , VBN NN CC JJ DT HYPH JJ NN NNS VBP JJ IN DT NN VBG IN JJ NN .

Three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who's assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to insure his silence before Young closes in.<br /><br />Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan, naturally, does his prototypical Angry White Male (and to the hilt), while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.<br /><br />The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). At least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and...).<br /><br />Curiously, Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. News of the Holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).<br /><br />But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. The victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating Ryan's murderous rage.", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "ADJ CCONJ ADV VERB PUNCT PROPN PROPN PART PROPN AUX DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT VERB ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADP PRON NOUN SCONJ VERB ADP ADP NOUN PUNCT NUM ADP PRON VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN PART NOUN SCONJ PROPN PROPN PUNCT ADJ CCONJ ADJ PUNCT VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT ADP NOUN SCONJ PRON VERB PART AUX ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN PROPN PROPN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB ADP PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NUM PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX VERB PUNCT PROPN VERB DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PART VERB PRON NOUN SCONJ ADJ VERB ADP PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP PRON NUM NOUN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT ADV PUNCT VERB PRON ADJ ADJ ADJ PROPN PUNCT CCONJ ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT SCONJ PROPN VERB ADP PRON ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT AUX PART ADJ PUNCT PUNCT ADJ AUX ADV AUX AUX ADJ PUNCT PROPN PROPN VERB PRON ADJ ADV VERB NOUN ADP DET ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PUNCT ADP DET ADJ NOUN PRON AUX VERB ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN VERB PRON ADP DET ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN PRON PRON VERB ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET ADV VERB PROPN ADV ADV VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON AUX ADV ADV VERB ADP PROPN PART NOUN ADP SCONJ PRON ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN DET NOUN ADV PUNCT ADV PUNCT ADV PUNCT VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADP ADJ PRON VERB DET NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT ADV ADJ PUNCT ADP SCONJ PROPN VERB PROPN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN CCONJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADV PUNCT PROPN VERB ADV DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP PRON PUNCT DET NOUN PRON AUX VERB ADP PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT DET PROPN PROPN PUNCT VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN ADP NUM AUX ADV ADP DET PROPN PUNCT NOUN ADP DET PROPN VERB PUNCT ADV PUNCT VERB PART VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT ADV PROPN VERB VERB PART VERB PRON NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN SCONJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ SCONJ DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADP ADJ PUNCT DET NOUN AUX PART VERB ADV ADV PUNCT DET NOUN PART VERB ADP DET ADJ PUNCT ADJ ADJ NOUN ADV VERB PRON ADV ADV VERB ADJ PUNCT ADV ADV PUNCT CCONJ ADV ADV PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN SCONJ DET NOUN AUX VERB ADV CCONJ VERB ADP ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB PROPN PART ADJ NOUN PUNCT", "xpos": "JJ CC RB VBG , NNP NNP POS NNP VBZ DT JJ NN NN , DT JJ `` NN '' NN VBG DT NN CC NNS IN DT JJ NN . -LRB- , NFP , NFP VBN IN NNP , NNP , DT NN IN NNS VBP IN PRP$ NN IN VBG RP IN NNS .

Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India, Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various Police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic.

The print quality is excellent, but this alone can't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull. There's a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the Templars (& set the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, ponderous &, ultimately, unfulfilling.

When we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's troubles. <br /><br />This initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel concern about appearing \"ridiculous\". The first half of the film may be described as \"slow\" by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). <br /><br />Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the Al Pacino film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta, accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecitt\u00e0 during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita \u00e8 Bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others.

I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. I was 100% wrong.<br /><br />Having watched it, I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker, since there is hardly any foul language, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! I don't usually go around hoping for it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort). Even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and worst of all not funny in the slightest--it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens' \"Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show\"). This would barely qualify as PG-13 (it is Not Rated), but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this--as if it was pornographic. Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse.<br /><br />It is, but not in that way.<br /><br />In a way, this worries me--the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning. If anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides (not this one, but better ones like The Virgin Suicides), it's teenagers. If both of those movies were rated R purely because of the suicide aspect, then I have little chance of turning a story I've been writing into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers (I think it's number 2), so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it.<br /><br />Just say no to this movie, though. 2/10.", "sentiment": "negative", "upos": "PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN ADP SYM NUM PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB ADJ PUNCT DET NOUN ADJ PUNCT ADP DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ SCONJ PRON VERB DET VERB NOUN NOUN ADP PRON PUNCT PRON VERB PRON AUX VERB PART AUX DET ADJ CCONJ ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX NUM SYM ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT AUX VERB PRON PUNCT PRON VERB PART VERB SCONJ PRON VERB DET VERB NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB ADV DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT PRON AUX PART ADV VERB SCONJ VERB ADP PRON PUNCT PUNCT VERB SCONJ DET NOUN AUX ADP PRON NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB PRON NOUN DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT SCONJ DET NOUN PRON PUNCT PRON AUX VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADV DET ADJ NOUN AUX ADJ PUNCT CCONJ ADJ PUNCT VERB PUNCT ADJ PUNCT ADJ PUNCT ADJ PUNCT CCONJ ADJ ADP DET PART ADJ ADP DET ADJ PUNCT PRON AUX AUX ADJ ADV PART VERB ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT PUNCT AUX PROPN VERB DET PROPN ADP PRON PROPN PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX ADV VERB ADP PROPN SYM NUM PUNCT PRON AUX PART VERB PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ PROPN VERB PART VERB PRON ADP DET NOUN ADP NUM VERB PRON PUNCT SCONJ SCONJ PRON AUX ADJ PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN AUX VERB ADP ADV CCONJ VERB DET VERB NOUN ADP PROPN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB SCONJ PROPN CCONJ PROPN AUX ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX PUNCT CCONJ PART ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB PRON PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB PRON AUX VERB NOUN AUX DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB PART VERB NOUN ADP ADV VERB NOUN PUNCT PART DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX NOUN PUNCT SCONJ DET ADP DET NOUN AUX VERB AUX ADV ADP ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PRON VERB ADJ NOUN SCONJ VERB DET NOUN PRON AUX AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT NUM NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN AUX NUM CCONJ DET NOUN CCONJ NUM PUNCT PUNCT NOUN AUX NUM ADP DET ADJ NUM VERB NOUN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB PRON AUX NOUN NUM PUNCT PUNCT ADV NOUN VERB SCONJ ADJ NOUN AUX AUX CCONJ AUX AUX VERB ADP PRON PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADV VERB INTJ ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT NUM PUNCT", "xpos": "PRP VBD DT NN IN NNP IN $ CD , IN PRP VBD JJ -LRB- DT NN JJ , IN DT NN IN NN VBG IN DT NN -RRB- , IN EX VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN , CC IN EX VBD DT VBN NN NN IN PRP .

Well, this didn't even really have one to begin with.<br /><br />Where to begin? The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction.<br /><br />Add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty, but not in the way you hope.<br /><br />Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80's (mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic 'daft' murder (don't worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before).<br /><br />After a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. What do they do? Slide down and run like the rest of us?

It was that listless and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it's the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, \"We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it\" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like, \"I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip\" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The \"reasoning\" behind each plot turn and new \"clue\" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for \"never shutting up.\" She's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a \"Dr.\" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, \"Don't you ever shut up?\" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it.

The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, Oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. The acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.<br /><br />The cinematography really brings out fifty's Hong Kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments.

I thought that \"God's Army\" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, \"well, maybe it will get better.\" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable.<br /><br />Dutcher's only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows (having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact) and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity.<br /><br />The conclusion, which I'm assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was both unbelievable (c'mon, the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and cheesy.

This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB DET NOUN NUM SYM NUM NOUN ADP DET ADJ NUM NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON ADV ADV VERB DET NOUN DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB PRON PART VERB DET NOUN SCONJ AUX VERB SCONJ PRON AUX CCONJ AUX PART ADP DET ADJ PUNCT ADV PUNCT PRON VERB PRON SCONJ PRON VERB DET ADJ SYM PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON ADV VERB PROPN PROPN VERB ADV ADV ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV ADP PROPN PUNCT PRON VERB PRON PUNCT VERB PRON VERB ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT AUX NUM ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN CCONJ VERB ADP DET NOUN AUX ADV ADJ ADP DET ADJ PUNCT ADV ADV ADP DET NOUN PRON AUX ADP ADJ NUM NOUN ADJ PUNCT ADJ PART VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN AUX ADV ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX AUX VERB PUNCT CCONJ AUX ADV VERB PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN PRON AUX ADP ADJ ADP DET ADJ AUX ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN AUX ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADV VERB ADJ ADP DET ADJ ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN PRON VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NUM ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN AUX DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB PUNCT CCONJ VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON NOUN AUX ADJ PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN AUX ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN", "xpos": "IN DT NN , PRP VBP VBN DT NN CD SYM CD NNS IN DT JJ CD NNS , CC PRP RB RB VBD DT NN DT NN .

In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union's headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />I'm not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few films do - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />When they marry, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />Similarly Tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be Eve's son by Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />The film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. Yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). Sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. So on the whole it is a first rate film. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "PROPN PROPN PART DET NOUN CCONJ DET PROPN AUX ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADP ADV NUM CCONJ NUM NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN SCONJ PRON VERB CCONJ ADV VERB ADP ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN PRON AUX VERB ADP NOUN SCONJ PROPN PROPN PART DET PROPN PROPN PROPN AUX VERB SCONJ DET PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN NOUN ADP PROPN AUX VERB ADP PROPN PART NOUN ADV PUNCT SCONJ AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET PROPN NOUN NOUN PUNCT PROPN VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON VERB ADV NUM NOUN PRON VERB NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT VERB PROPN PUNCT DET PROPN PROPN NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PROPN PUNCT CCONJ PROPN DET NOUN PUNCT DET VERB PRON CCONJ PRON ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT VERB PRON NOUN CCONJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADP NOUN DET ADV VERB PRON CCONJ PRON ADJ NOUN SCONJ PRON AUX VERB PRON NOUN ADP PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADV VERB ADP ADJ VERB NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX PART DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT INTJ PUNCT ADP PROPN PRON AUX ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PRON AUX PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN SCONJ AUX NOUN ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB ADV NUM NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX PROPN PART ADJ NOUN NOUN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT CCONJ PRON NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PRON VERB DET ADV NUM ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADP NOUN ADP PROPN ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB PUNCT AUX VERB ADP PRON NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT PRON PRON VERB CCONJ VERB PUNCT PRON NOUN AUX ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADV DET NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB PRON NOUN ADP PUNCT PROPN VERB ADV CCONJ ADV ADJ ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN AUX NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON AUX PART VERB PART AUX VERB ADP ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT PROPN VERB PROPN PART NOUN ADP DET PROPN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ SCONJ PRON VERB PRON ADP DET NOUN ADP PRON NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PROPN PART NOUN VERB PRON SCONJ PROPN VERB NOUN CCONJ NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT ADV VERB ADP DET PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADV PRON VERB NUM NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NUM AUX ADJ ADJ CCONJ NUM AUX ADJ ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX PART ADV VERB DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN SCONJ ADV VERB PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN VERB PUNCT VERB DET ADP PROPN PROPN PART ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ PRON AUX ADJ SCONJ DET NOUN AUX VERB ADV ADV PART VERB NUM PART NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN PROPN ADP PRON NOUN PROPN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN AUX ADV VERB ADV PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB PUNCT PROPN VERB PART VERB ADV PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT PART VERB PRON NOUN CCONJ PRON NOUN DET NOUN PRON ADV VERB PUNCT CCONJ ADP PROPN ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PROPN AUX ADV ADJ SCONJ VERB DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB PRON CCONJ VERB PRON ADV PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB PRON ADV ADP NOUN ADV ADV PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT CCONJ PRON ADV VERB PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PROPN VERB ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PRON VERB PRON PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADV PROPN ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB PRON DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PROPN VERB PROPN PUNCT CCONJ VERB PRON ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB ADP PART AUX PROPN PART NOUN ADP PROPN PART NOUN PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB PROPN PART VERB PRON PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN AUX PART DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADP NOUN ADJ PUNCT CCONJ PRON AUX VERB DET NOUN VERB ADJ PUNCT VERB DET NOUN SCONJ PROPN VERB PRON PROPN ADP PROPN ADP PRON NOUN PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN SCONJ VERB DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PROPN VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV PRON AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADV ADP DET NOUN PRON AUX DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET PROPN PROPN ADV PUNCT CCONJ ADP NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT", "xpos": "NNP NNP POS DT NN CC DT NNP VBD JJ IN DT NN IN RB CD CC CD NNS IN DT JJ NNS WRB PRP VBD CC RB VBD RP IN NN .

Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is \"Presented in Shaw Scope\", just like the good old days.<br /><br />This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.<br /><br />Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.<br /><br />Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way.<br /><br />Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to!

The case of young and innocent, in never handling or firing a gun, Jimmy Davis, Franchot Tone, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men, like Jimmy Davis, are forced to take up arms for their country.<br /><br />Jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the US Army but was encouraged to stay, by being belted in the mouth, by his good friend Fred P. Willis, Spencer Tracy, ended up on the front lines in France. With Jimmy's unit pinned down by a German machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen German soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple. It was when Jimmy gunned down the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him.<br /><br />Recovering from his wounds at an Army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army volunteer nurse Rose Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend the happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. It's when Fred was lost during the fighting on the Western Front that Rose, thinking that he was killed, fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred unexpectedly showed up in the French town where Jimmy, now fully recovered from his wounds, was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and Rose who had already accepted Jimmy's proposal of marriage to her!<br /><br />With WWI over and Jimmy marrying Rose left Fred, who's still in love with her, a bitter and resentful young man. It was almost by accident that Fred ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front. Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, Jimmy had become a top mobster in New York City's underworld! Not only that but as Fred later found out his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved in with Jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster.<br /><br />Jimmy's life of crime came full circle when Rose, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a \"Valentine Day\" like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters. While on trial Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together. <br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** Hearing rumors from fellow convicts that Rose and his best friend Fred were having an affair behind his back Jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law. It's at Fred's circus, where he works as both manger and barker, that Jimmy in seeing that Rose as well as Fred were true to him that he, like at his trial, had a sudden change of heart. But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for Jimmy! It was then that Jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job, that he himself didn't have the heart to do, for him!", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADV ADV PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN ADV ADV ADP ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PRON AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN PUNCT ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP ADJ CCONJ ADJ PUNCT SCONJ ADV VERB CCONJ VERB DET NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT AUX AUX VERB NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN SCONJ NOUN PUNCT ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT AUX VERB PART VERB ADP NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PROPN PRON ADP ADV VERB PART AUX VERB ADP ADP DET PROPN PROPN CCONJ AUX VERB PART VERB PUNCT SCONJ AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PROPN PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT VERB ADP ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT ADP PROPN PART NOUN VERB ADP ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN PRON ADV ADV VERB PRON ADP ADP NOUN VERB ADP DET ADJ NUM ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX SCONJ PROPN VERB ADP DET ADJ VERB PROPN PUNCT PRON VERB PRON NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT SCONJ DET NOUN NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADV VERB PRON PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT VERB ADP PRON NOUN ADP DET PROPN NOUN PROPN VERB ADP NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN NOUN NOUN PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT NOUN AUX ADV ADP NOUN ADP PROPN PART ADJ NOUN DET ADJ NOUN ADJ PROPN ADP PRON ADJ NOUN ADP PRON PUNCT PRON AUX SCONJ PROPN AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ PROPN PRON VERB PUNCT VERB SCONJ PRON AUX VERB PUNCT VERB ADP NOUN CCONJ ADV VERB PROPN PUNCT SCONJ PROPN ADV VERB ADP ADP DET ADJ NOUN SCONJ PROPN PUNCT ADV ADV VERB ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT AUX VERB ADP NOUN AUX ADV ADJ ADP CCONJ PRON CCONJ PROPN PRON AUX ADV VERB PROPN PART NOUN ADP NOUN ADP PRON PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADP PROPN ADV CCONJ PROPN VERB PROPN VERB PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADP NOUN ADP PRON PUNCT DET ADJ CCONJ ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADP NOUN PRON PROPN VERB ADP PROPN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN PROPN CCONJ VERB ADP PRON NOUN CCONJ NOUN SCONJ PRON ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN PRON PRON VERB SCONJ PRON AUX VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET ADJ ADJ PROPN PUNCT ADJ CCONJ ADJ ADP PRON PUNCT CCONJ PRON NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT PROPN AUX VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT ADV ADV PRON CCONJ SCONJ PROPN ADV VERB ADP PRON NOUN PROPN VERB DET NOUN PRON PROPN AUX ADV ADJ ADP ADP PROPN VERB PRON SCONJ PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PROPN PART NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN SCONJ PROPN PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB ADP ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB PRON ADP ADP DET NOUN PART VERB PRON SCONJ VERB DET PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP PRON NOUN NOUN VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ ADP NOUN PROPN VERB ADP PRON NOUN CCONJ VERB PRON NOUN ADJ PART VERB DET NOUN CCONJ ADV PUNCT SCONJ PRON NUM NOUN NOUN AUX ADP PUNCT VERB PRON NOUN ADV ADV PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PRON VERB CCONJ PRON ADJ NOUN PROPN AUX VERB DET NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PROPN VERB ADP ADP NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADP PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PROPN SCONJ VERB SCONJ PROPN ADV ADV SCONJ PROPN AUX ADJ ADP PRON SCONJ PRON PUNCT ADP ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN SCONJ VERB ADV ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP ADP ADJ DET NUM NOUN VERB ADP ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT AUX ADV ADV ADJ ADP PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV SCONJ PROPN VERB PART VERB PRON DET SCONJ VERB DET NOUN PRON ADP ADV VERB PRON ADP VERB DET NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON PRON AUX PART VERB DET NOUN PART VERB PUNCT ADP PRON PUNCT", "xpos": "NFP NNS NFP RB RB , IN JJ NN RB RB IN IN DT NNS , JJ NN WDT VBZ IN JJ JJ NNS WP VBP VBN IN DT NN NN IN DT NN , CC NN , IN PRP$ NNS .

After a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards.<br /><br />You have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela's house.

It's really a shame that when a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him can't be denied the right to ever vote again. They've clearly shown they have no sense of character.<br /><br />What really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as Robespierre; a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can't help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he's helped create. Sound like any belligerent, overprivileged, retarded Yale cheerleaders you know of? <br /><br />Wojciech Pszoniak blows the slovenly Deparidieu off the screen.

It requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and REALLY believable acting (aka GREAT acting). <br /><br />Such is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. It's downhill from there.<br /><br />Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon. But to be fair to Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he began wanting to do a REAL doc, couldn't get funding, and settled for a cheaper way of making his film.<br /><br />The premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'host,' hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites -- all, I guess, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work.

Of course it's not going to be an Oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes.<br /><br />The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. It's just them fighting back throughout the whole film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole film) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing, and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience.<br /><br />I'd give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that only. Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on, as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment, something to pass time if you're bored, and nothing else.<br /><br />4/10", "sentiment": "negative", "upos": "DET PROPN VERB PROPN NUM AUX PRON PRON AUX VERB PRON PART AUX CCONJ PRON ADV PUNCT ADP NOUN PRON AUX PART VERB PART AUX DET PROPN VERB NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADJ NOUN PRON PRON AUX ADV VERB PRON ADP ADP NUM NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN AUX ADV ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN NOUN PRON VERB PRON VERB ADP DET ADJ VERB NOUN ADP PRON ADJ NOUN SCONJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV PRON VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN AUX ADV VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADV CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PRON AUX ADV VERB ADV PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX VERB DET PROPN VERB PROPN NUM NUM ADP ADP NUM ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON ADV PUNCT SCONJ ADV ADV PRON VERB PRON VERB ADP PRON NOUN ADV CCONJ ADV SCONJ DET NOUN VERB ADV PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB PART VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN PRON VERB PART VERB CCONJ VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN NOUN ADV PART VERB ADJ DET NOUN VERB ADJ PUNCT DET PROPN VERB PROPN NUM AUX ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON PART VERB NOUN SCONJ PRON AUX ADJ PUNCT CCONJ PRON ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT NUM", "xpos": "DT NNPS VBP NNPS CD VBZ WP PRP MD VB PRP TO VB CC NN RBR .

There's a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid.

As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale 'war effort' of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militia, the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcock's sensibilities.<br /><br />This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who don't believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks' and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security, he falls madly in love with! Of course in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix.<br /><br />In good form for this outing, Hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies, average Joes, and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals, pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving. It's a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited, culminates in one of Hitchcock's more memorable finales. Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the war-time 'shooting ban' on public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's most well known films, it's a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual - terrific Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcock's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film. Hitchcock's original cameo idea that was shot (him fighting in sign language with his 'deaf' wife) was axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf!", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADP PROPN PART ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN VERB ADP PROPN PROPN PART ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP DET ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN ADP PRON ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ DET PROPN VERB ADP PROPN PROPN NUM CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN CCONJ ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET VERB NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADP ADJ CCONJ ADV ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADV VERB NOUN ADP ADJ CCONJ ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT VERB DET NOUN AUX ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN PROPN PROPN VERB PROPN SCONJ VERB DET NOUN PRON VERB PRON VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PROPN PROPN PUNCT ADP PRON ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN SCONJ VERB ADP PRON ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN AUX DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET ADV VERB NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NUM NOUN ADJ PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PRON PUNCT SCONJ ADP NOUN ADP DET PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PUNCT VERB ADJ NOUN PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN ADV AUX VERB SCONJ VERB NOUN PUNCT VERB DET NOUN PRON AUX PART VERB PRON ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADJ NOUN ADP PRON NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN CCONJ ADV ADJ PROPN PROPN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADJ ADP ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PRON PUNCT ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP PRON NOUN ADV ADV ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADV ADP NOUN ADP PUNCT ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT VERB ADP DET VERB NOUN PROPN PUNCT VERB ADP PRON NOUN ADV VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PROPN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN PRON VERB NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN CCONJ VERB NOUN PART VERB NOUN VERB PUNCT PRON AUX DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB PRON NOUN VERB ADV CCONJ ADV VERB PUNCT VERB ADP NUM ADP PROPN PART ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB ADP ADV NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADP PRON AUX VERB ADP NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN ADP ADP DET ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT SCONJ PROPN AUX PART AUX NUM ADP PROPN PART ADV ADV VERB NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX DET ADJ NOUN PRON AUX ADV ADJ CCONJ VERB ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADP ADJ PUNCT ADJ PROPN NOUN PUNCT VERB PART VERB ADP PROPN PART NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PROPN PART ADJ NOUN NOUN PRON AUX VERB PUNCT PRON VERB ADP NOUN NOUN ADP PRON PUNCT ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT AUX VERB ADP DET PROPN ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN PRON AUX ADJ SCONJ VERB DET NOUN PUNCT", "xpos": "DT NNS , , NFP , NFP IN NNP POS JJ JJ JJ NN , NNP VBN IN NNP NNP POS JJ NN IN JJ NN CC NN , PRP VBD IN DT IN DT RBR JJ NNS IN PRP$ JJ JJ NN HYPH JJ NN CC NN .

Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.<br /><br />The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men, each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.<br /><br />This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use, though. For although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.<br /><br />Yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are Finney, Courtenay, and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there aren't other fine performances, most notably Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.<br /><br />Although it doesn't get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates), and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />I had remembered this as being a good movie, but I wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about, and be hugely entertained all the while, then I encourage you to see The Dresser.", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "PRON ADV VERB DET PROPN DET NOUN PUNCT AUX ADV VERB PRON ADV ADV PUNCT ADV DET NUM NOUN ADV PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX PART DET PUNCT ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ AUX PART VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON PROPN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP DET NUM NOUN VERB PRON ADV ADP ADJ PUNCT PROPN PROPN CCONJ PROPN PROPN AUX PRON ADJ ADP ADJ ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET PROPN AUX DET NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT DET VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ PRON NOUN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN NUM PUNCT PRON AUX NUM NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ ADP DET ADJ PUNCT PROPN AUX ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN PART VERB PUNCT ADV PUNCT CCONJ VERB PRON SCONJ VERB ADV ADP PRON ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT CCONJ PROPN VERB PRON NOUN ADV ADP PROPN PUNCT ADP PROPN PART VERB PRON PUNCT PRON AUX PRON PUNCT CCONJ VERB PRON AUX PUNCT ADV PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX DET NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN AUX ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADP ADJ PUNCT PRON VERB NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PART VERB PRON ADP NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT ADV NUM NOUN ADJ PUNCT AUX ADV ADJ ADP DET ADV ADJ PUNCT ADV ADJ PUNCT ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB CCONJ VERB ADP PRON ADJ NOUN ADV SCONJ PRON AUX VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PROPN AUX ADV ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV VERB ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADP ADP DET NOUN ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN AUX ADV DET ADJ NOUN PART VERB PUNCT ADV PUNCT ADP SCONJ PUNCT ADV PRON NOUN AUX SCONJ ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT ADJ ADP DET NOUN PROPN CCONJ PROPN VERB ADP PRON ADV ADV ADP DET ADJ VERB NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT INTJ PUNCT PRON VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB DET NOUN SCONJ DET ADJ NOUN AUX PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX PART PART VERB SCONJ PRON VERB PART ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV ADV PROPN PROPN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PROPN PUNCT PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN SCONJ PROPN CCONJ PROPN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON AUX AUX AUX PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX PART AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ VERB SCONJ DET PROPN AUX VERB ADP NUM PROPN PROPN PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP CCONJ PROPN CCONJ PROPN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADJ PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ ADJ VERB PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT AUX VERB PRON SCONJ AUX DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON AUX PART VERB PART AUX ADV ADV VERB SCONJ PRON AUX SCONJ VERB ADP VERB PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB PART VERB DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN AUX ADV ADP PUNCT CCONJ AUX ADV VERB DET DET NOUN PUNCT ADV PRON VERB PRON PART VERB DET PROPN PUNCT", "xpos": "PRP RB VBD DT NNP DT NN , VBG RB VBN PRP RB RB , RB DT CD NNS RB , , , , PRP VBZ RB DT `` JJ '' NN , CC VBZ RB VB TO VB DT JJ NN , CC PRP$ NNP , DT NN IN DT CD NNS VBZ PRP RB IN JJ .

There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements.

Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those \"helping\" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the towns police force, a small-time reporter, a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict, a young priest and his mother, An old man who practices witchcraft and his female prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a mentally handicapped townsman, and a deaf/mute little girl. All of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns, until the actual killer is revealed...<br /><br />DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a \"classical\" giallo or a typical Fulci gore film. Although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence (although nothing nearly as strong as some of Fulci's later works). This is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. Recommended for giallo/murder-mystery fans, or anyone looking to check out some of Fulci's non-splatter films - but don't despair, DON'T TORTURE still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze. Some may be put off by the subject of the child killings, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doesn't bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8.5/10", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "PROPN PROPN DET NOUN AUX NUM ADP PROPN PART ADV PUNCT CCONJ ADV PUNCT ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADJ PUNCT PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ SCONJ ADV DET ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PRON PROPN AUX VERB ADP PUNCT PRON AUX ADV DET ADV ADJ CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN SCONJ DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN AUX VERB PUNCT DET ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADP NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET PUNCT VERB PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADP DET NOUN DET PUNCT PUNCT VERB DET NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ CCONJ ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ PRON NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB NOUN CCONJ PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET ADJ SYM ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET ADP DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN PART VERB ADJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ DET ADJ NOUN AUX VERB PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT NOUN NOUN DET NOUN AUX CCONJ DET PUNCT ADJ PUNCT ADJ CCONJ DET ADJ PROPN NOUN NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX VERB NOUN ADP DET PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON ADV ADV ADJ ADP DET ADP PROPN PART ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX DET ADV VERB NOUN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PRON VERB PRON VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN PUNCT VERB ADP ADJ SYM NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB PART VERB ADP DET ADP PROPN PART ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ AUX PART VERB PUNCT PROPN PROPN ADV VERB ADJ ADP PRON AUX ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT DET AUX AUX VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ NUM ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN SCONJ VERB ADP ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV NOUN ADP ADJ PUNCT CCONJ SCONJ DET NOUN ADP NOUN AUX PART VERB PRON PUNCT ADV ADV VERB DET NUM DET NOUN PUNCT NUM", "xpos": "NNP NNP DT NN VBZ CD IN NNP POS RBR -LRB- CC RB , IN NNS IN NN HYPH NN , JJR , -RRB- NNS , CC IN RB DT JJ `` NN '' WDT NNP VBZ VBN IN , DT VBZ RB DT RB JJ CC JJ NN .

Determined to free her master, the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success; but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor, which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive, troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark.<br /><br />Now Alexandra must find a replacement gem, which isn't going to be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex-lover, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis), who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, wise-cracking inter-dimensional half-pints Lite and Dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home.<br /><br />In the warped movie world of Jim Wynorski, all females are big-breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker.

Okay...so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies.

The writer obviously bought the playbook \"How to write a space disaster movie\" and followed it play by play. In particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.<br /><br />Max Q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. But, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. To learn that the film was nominated for a \"Special Visual Effects\" Emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.<br /><br />I think a handful of high school students with a pass in Media Studies could have created more believable effects!<br /><br />And the plot holes are too numerous to mention. But I will pick one out as an example. Now, I'm no NASA expert, but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.<br /><br />The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell.

And then I'm comin' upstairs junior, and I'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight a**! Do we have an understanding?). Offsetting his small role however, is Dan Acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for Bill Murray. His voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid.

If the film was a little grainy it might have added some \"creepiness factor\" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. It's not that shocking, it's not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some \"gore\" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda's \"sequel\" to AFTERMATH (now available as a \"double feature\" released by Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good director Cerda really is when given the right material.

Its not just about entertainment. There's tonnes of subtle messages that i think Yasmin was trying to bring across. And yes, it might be confusing to some of you(especially if you didn't watch Sepet and/or Gubra for 76 times).<br /><br />I bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? Its really ironic how the characters relate. Like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from Gubra. And the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br /><br />And i absolutely love the voice-overs. Its crude yet awakeningly fresh. Like, when they took a shot of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin signboard, then there was suddenly Mukhsin's voice saying 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim..' (the scene when he climbed the tree).<br /><br />It captured Malaysian's attitude(and in some mild way, sniggering at how pathetic it is) portrayed in the character. For example, even the kids can be really sharp tongued(complete with the shrill annoying voice) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. And how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl, when ur own life isn't sorted out. <br /><br />All i can say is, this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it. <br /><br />It kept me glued to the screen, i couldn't even take my eyes off it.

He goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something... So , then I turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on. The movie is excellent. We then see this young boy now a man; professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood. Then we meet the true focus of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in Francis winning. Don't want to give away too much . I was up until 2 A.M.

I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer, all we'd need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants.<br /><br />While Tobe Hooper's crocky opus referenced his own movies, Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies. See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages?/rip-offs to Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000, and any James Bond movie. Also, try to find the ready-for-tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock.<br /><br />I was disappointed the crock didn't get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism...or crocky appreciation, but the quasi-Captain Ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach. Perhaps, in the coming years, we'll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset. Or hopefully, a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero-G monkey/midget/crocodile bloodshed.<br /><br />All-in-all, the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me.", "sentiment": "negative", "upos": "SCONJ VERB PROPN PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT ADP NUM PUNCT PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN SYM NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN SYM NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADP ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN PUNCT SCONJ ADV PROPN PROPN AUX VERB PRON ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP PROPN VERB DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN ADJ ADP NOUN VERB NOUN ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET PRON AUX VERB AUX AUX DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN NOUN CCONJ PROPN PROPN ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT SCONJ PROPN PROPN PART NOUN NOUN VERB PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN VERB PART VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB SCONJ PRON AUX VERB ADP DET PROPN ADP DET PROPN NOUN NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN SYM NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PART ADJ PROPN PUNCT DET PROPN PUNCT PROPN NUM PUNCT CCONJ DET PROPN PROPN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT VERB PART VERB DET ADJ PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN NOUN SCONJ DET NOUN VERB ADP SCONJ VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ DET NOUN AUX PART VERB PART VERB ADP PRON NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET PROPN PROPN ADP DET NOUN AUX VERB PRON NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT ADP DET VERB NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB DET NOUN VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADV PUNCT DET NOUN AUX VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN SYM NOUN SYM NOUN NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET PUNCT ADJ PUNCT DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN VERB PRON PUNCT", "xpos": "IN VBG NNP NNP POS NN , NNP , IN CD , PRP VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NN , NN NN IN DT NN , NN NN .

Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety. No they don't because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman.<br /><br />That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and he knows what Coburn is after. As he explains it to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a Waco like standoff. His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired. It's not something he's proud of, she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt.<br /><br />Lest we feel sorry for Coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else off the screen when he's on. <br /><br />Coburn gets the bright idea of making sure Heston trails him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can't touch him. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then.<br /><br />Coburn's gang includes, Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox, and Jorge Rivero.

Turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. There's a problem- and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! And with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature/killer/whatever. Entrails of a Virgin has neither. It's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie, even if isn't one of the very worst ever made- it's there just for horn-dog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their 'other' heads.<br /><br />In this case, we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by \"A Murderer\" as he's credited. First off, the director Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in (or phoned in, take your pick) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. It looks like it's from another movie. Then once settled into the house, there's a 'wrestling' scene that's poorly choreographed and shot (yeah, we really need to see him 'all' there), and then on to the rape and killings. First the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. Then the Murderer, who like D'Amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial, and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.<br /><br />Now, the latter of those, taken by themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. This is like saying, however, that the cro\u00fbtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. An eye-gouging scene, a spike thrown like an Olympic event (that scene, actually, is kind of cool), and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl, whose inconsequential name I can't remember. Even *this* becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! On top of this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through 'Gaira' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway, are dubbed over by the actors (you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough, hence the need to let them 'speak' for themselves). But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one, where it's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror (watch as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the picture, tries to stop the murderer from getting to her, which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!) You just want it to be done with, for the 'I hate women' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether.", "sentiment": "negative", "upos": "ADV PRON AUX DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT ADV ADV DET NOUN ADP DET PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX ADP DET NOUN SCONJ PRON VERB VERB PUNCT INTJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET PROPN PART AUX ADP ADJ DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB ADP PRON AUX NOUN ADV ADJ ADP PRON ADJ ADJ PUNCT CCONJ ADJ PUNCT CCONJ PRON PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON AUX VERB PRON ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PROPN PROPN PUNCT ADJ ADP PRON ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ ADV VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT ADV ADJ NOUN CCONJ PRON AUX VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PART ADV ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN ADP ADV ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADP DET VERB NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB PART AUX ADP ADJ DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADV ADV DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT SCONJ VERB DET NOUN SYM NOUN SYM PRON PUNCT NOUN ADP DET PROPN VERB ADV PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ PART VERB PRON AUX DET ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV SCONJ AUX PART NUM ADP DET ADV ADV ADV VERB PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADV ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADP ADP NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN PRON VERB DET PRON NOUN ADP PRON PUNCT ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB DET NOUN NOUN SCONJ DET NOUN AUX VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON ADV ADJ PUNCT CCONJ ADV ADP NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN NUM NOUN CCONJ AUX VERB ADP NUM ADP NUM ADP PUNCT DET PROPN PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX VERB PUNCT ADV ADP PUNCT DET NOUN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PROPN VERB PRON VERB PART VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADV ADV PUNCT PRON AUX VERB ADP PUNCT CCONJ VERB ADP PUNCT VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADP NUM ADP DET NOUN VERB NOUN ADP NUM CCONJ ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADV PUNCT PRON VERB SCONJ PRON AUX ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PRON AUX ADV VERB CCONJ VERB PUNCT INTJ PUNCT PRON ADV VERB PART VERB PRON PUNCT DET PUNCT ADV PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ ADV ADV ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT ADV DET NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN DET NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT ADV DET PROPN PUNCT PRON ADP PROPN PART NOUN AUX ADV VERB ADP NOUN CCONJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB DET NOUN CCONJ PUNCT CCONJ NOUN DET NOUN NUM ADP NUM PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET NOUN ADP PRON PUNCT VERB ADP PRON PUNCT AUX AUX VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX SCONJ VERB PUNCT ADV PUNCT SCONJ DET NOUN AUX DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADV NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT AUX NOUN ADP ADJ PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ ADV DET NOUN ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON ADJ NOUN PRON AUX PART VERB PUNCT ADV PUNCT PRON PUNCT VERB ADJ ADV SCONJ ADV AUX ADJ ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN ADP PRON PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADJ ADP PUNCT PROPN PUNCT CCONJ PRON NOUN ADP NOUN VERB PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN SCONJ PRON ADP DET ADJ NOUN AUX VERB ADV PUNCT AUX VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB SCONJ PRON VERB PART AUX VERB PRON ADV PUNCT ADV DET NOUN PART VERB PRON PUNCT VERB PUNCT ADP PRON PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN ADP DET PROPN AUX PRON ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX ADV ADV PART AUX VERB ADP CCONJ ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB SCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ PUNCT DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT VERB PART VERB DET NOUN SCONJ VERB ADP PRON PUNCT PRON VERB NUM NOUN SCONJ PRON VERB VERB NOUN ADP PRON PUNCT PUNCT PRON ADV VERB PRON PART AUX VERB ADP PUNCT ADP DET PUNCT PRON VERB NOUN PART NOUN PART VERB ADP CCONJ AUX ADJ ADV PUNCT", "xpos": "RB PRP VBD DT NN , CC DT NN -LRB- RB RB DT NN IN DT NNP , WDT VBZ IN DT NN IN PRP VBZ VBG `` UH , NNS '' IN DT NN IN DT NN -RRB- , CC PRP VBD NNS IN NNS IN DT NNP TO VB IN JJS DT NN IN JJ NN IN DT JJ NN NNS CC JJ , JJ NNS IN DT JJ JJ NN .

I make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. All I knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb readers gave it a 7.8, Rotten Tomatoes users ranked it at 7.9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8.2! If anything, they UNDERRATED this little gem.<br /><br />Filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents \"for posterity\" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents, outspoken mother Mina, and less than forthcoming dad, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (Mike & Mina's son Doug) was going to take us. As a matter of fact, I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with this!<br /><br />Life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. It is difficult to verbalize just how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. Absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must-see even if you aren't a fan of the documentary genre. This film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. \"51 Birch Street\" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you.

As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.<br /><br />The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that's titled \"The Number 23\" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.<br /><br />The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills.

I wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they ALL end. If you don't want to know much about the plot, don't keep reading.<br /><br />Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. He is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role.<br /><br />The two meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. Two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. I wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell.<br /><br />I wanted mindless entertainment, and I got it with this.

It only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re-invented over and over again. Take superheroes for example, for each X-Man and Spiderman, there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worst. It only took The Ring, which was pitch-perfect (mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to bring a ton of look-alike creepy-woman based horrors, e.g. The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was fine, but pointless), and the grudges.<br /><br />The first Grudge wasn't entirely bad. It was scary most of the way, which is what one could expect from it. Plus, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous; this could be a good thing, but hey, what boy Men in Black II? Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain? For the Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way.<br /><br />Tired scares, bad acting (except for Amber Tamblyn), and clich\u00e9s all over the place. Three stories take place, on different places and time. There is Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigating what drove her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place; and finally, an American family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door. Glad to say (and I mean it) that everything is tied up at the end, but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture, when everything else is simply tiresome and dull.<br /><br />The chills are all over there, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who shouldn't enter a house, others that dig too deep. Meanwhile, ghosts keep killing and killing and killing, which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic.

It also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a sweet story about three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (Winninger) is marrying again. Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intended, called \"Precious\" (Barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (Brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count. This is arranged by their father's accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (Milland). What a mess.<br /><br />This is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. The young women are pretty and all do good work. The emphasis, of course, is on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer. In fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. She sings a delightful \"Il Bacio\" in a police station.<br /><br />One of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as the gold-digger isn't all that young, but the girls' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters.<br /><br />Universal gives Durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie. Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is.<br /><br />Very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna.", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN CCONJ PROPN PROPN AUX PUNCT NUM ADJ PROPN PUNCT ADP DET PROPN NOUN ADP NUM PUNCT PRON VERB PROPN PROPN ADP NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON ADV VERB PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN CCONJ PROPN PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX DET ADJ NOUN ADP NUM ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV VERB ADP PROPN ADP PRON VERB NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT AUX VERB ADV PUNCT PART AUX VERB PRON ADP NUM NOUN CCONJ VERB PRON NOUN ADV VERB PRON PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN SYM NOUN PUNCT VERB PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT VERB SCONJ DET VERB PUNCT VERB PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PROPN PUNCT AUX PRON CCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB CCONJ VERB ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PRON VERB ADP PRON PART AUX VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB ADP PRON NOUN PART NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN PRON VERB AUX DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN VERB PRON ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PRON DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON AUX DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV ADJ CCONJ ADV ADJ ADP DET PUNCT ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PROPN CCONJ PROPN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN AUX ADV CCONJ DET VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT AUX ADP ADJ PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET ADV PUNCT VERB NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON NOUN ADP DET NOUN AUX ADV ADV ADV SCONJ PRON AUX AUX ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB ADV ADP SCONJ PRON VERB ADV ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET ADJ PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT NUM ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT VERB ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT PART VERB PRON NOUN ADV PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB PRON CCONJ VERB PART VERB PRON PUNCT PROPN SCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN AUX PART DET DET ADJ PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN PART NOUN VERB ADV ADP ADV PUNCT ADV DET NOUN ADV AUX DET ADJ NOUN VERB PRON NOUN ADP DET ADJ PUNCT ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN PRON AUX VERB ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PROPN VERB PROPN DET ADJ NOUN NOUN ADV PUNCT PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN ADP DET NOUN AUX ADV VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON AUX ADV AUX DET NOUN ADV PART VERB NOUN SCONJ ADJ CCONJ ADJ PRON AUX PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADV ADJ CCONJ ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT", "xpos": "NNP NNP , NNP NNP CC NNP NNP VBP `` NNP NNP NNPS '' IN DT NNP NN IN CD , WDT VBZ NNP NNP IN NN NNS .

Other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Kitchens in the major roles. Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye.

English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View, passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father, an impudent, violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's in the Pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles all influence eachother, but each is seperate, and utterly unique. He changes completely, with each character he takes on. And I'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything. Anything.<br /><br />As Cristy Brown he is stunning. He does not ridicule the character, and he does not pity the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human.<br /><br />This movie, despite small scene-transition faults and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it's predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this isn't a Hollywood movie.<br /><br />My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax. \"I'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated.\" \"Wheel out the cripple!\" And his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again again, and I never get tired of Cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />A must-see.

The movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.<br /><br />If it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn't be much good. The movie's most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making Hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus' followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist. So it's got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn't do anything useful with them.<br /><br />Bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic sons.

You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, it never does. At least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. Lion's Gate completely deceives on this bombshell... No...this is a disaster. After watching this film, you would swear George W.

Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it, while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space.<br /><br />The story begins much like any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arriving at Peach's castle Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle up into space. In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Luma's home, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space station's Power Stars and scattered them across the universe, it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach, thus the adventure begins.<br /><br />The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of multiple planets that Mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars. Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are big, many planets are similar to classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game are the controls, all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same, but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and it will as well activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there is the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks, you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games.<br /><br />My only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to, and also the story is pretty weak. The worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives. Still these minor problems aside it's a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging. This is the type of game that we've been waiting for on the Wii.<br /><br />A perfect 10 out of 10!", "sentiment": "positive", "upos": "PRON AUX AUX DET PROPN NOUN ADP ADV ADV SCONJ PRON AUX VERB PUNCT PRON VERB ADV ADJ NOUN SCONJ VERB PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN AUX VERB ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN SCONJ VERB PRON ADJ PUNCT ADV PROPN PROPN AUX DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ PROPN NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADV ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ PROPN ADP PRON PUNCT SCONJ ADV VERB ADJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT DET ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB SCONJ DET NOUN VERB NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ PROPN NOUN PUNCT PROPN VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN VERB PRON ADP DET NOUN ADP PRON NOUN ADP DET PROPN PROPN PUNCT SCONJ VERB ADP PROPN PART NOUN PROPN VERB PROPN CCONJ PRON NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT VERB DET NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT PROPN VERB PROPN PROPN CCONJ ADV VERB PRON NOUN ADP ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP NOUN PROPN VERB ADP CCONJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN VERB PROPN CCONJ AUX VERB ADV ADP DET PROPN PART NOUN PUNCT DET VERB NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PROPN VERB ADJ ADJ PROPN CCONJ ADV VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB PROPN PUNCT PROPN VERB PROPN SCONJ PROPN AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN PART NOUN NOUN CCONJ VERB PRON ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADP ADP PROPN PART VERB DET PROPN VERB PRON CCONJ VERB PROPN PUNCT ADV DET NOUN VERB PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN PRON VERB DET NOUN AUX SCONJ VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PRON PROPN VERB ADV ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PROPN AUX ADP ADJ NOUN VERB DET DET NOUN ADP NOUN SCONJ VERB NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN AUX ADJ CCONJ NOUN AUX ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN AUX ADJ ADP ADJ PROPN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN AUX DET NOUN PUNCT DET ADP DET NOUN ADP VERB CCONJ ADJ AUX ADV DET ADJ PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN PROPN AUX VERB DET NOUN PRON AUX VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON AUX ADV ADV VERB DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ VERB DET NOUN PART VERB NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV PRON VERB DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADP ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADV ADJ PART VERB SCONJ ADJ DET NOUN VERB PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADV VERB PRON VERB ADV ADJ ADP DET NUM NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB SCONJ DET VERB NOUN ADP NOUN VERB DET AUX VERB ADP PUNCT CCONJ ADV DET NOUN AUX ADV ADJ PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB SCONJ PRON VERB DET ADP PRON NOUN SCONJ PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN SCONJ ADJ PRON VERB SCONJ PRON VERB VERB PRON VERB ADP NUM NOUN PUNCT ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADV PRON AUX DET ADJ NOUN PRON AUX ADV ADJ CCONJ AUX ADV ADJ PUNCT PRON AUX DET NOUN ADP NOUN PRON PRON AUX AUX VERB ADP ADP DET PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT NOUN ADJ NUM ADP ADP NUM PUNCT", "xpos": "PRP VBP VBN DT NNP NN IN RB RB IN PRP MD VB , PRP VBP RB JJ NNS IN VBG NNP NNP NNP IN DT NN , DT NN VBZ VBN RB JJ IN DT NNS IN VBG NN JJ .

The short film stars Edward the Spatula who after being fired from his job, joins in the fight against the evil spoons. This premise allows for some funny content near the beginning, but is barely present for the remainder of the feature. This film's 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately not much else lies below it. The plot that is set up doesn't really have time to show. But it's surely follows it plot better than many high-budget Hollywood films. This film is worth watching at least a few times.
